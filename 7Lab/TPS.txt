4. Line 12, is an instruction to jump to line 20. Line 20 adds the registers $a0 and $a1 and loads the value into $v0.
5. I believe we cannot use the "j $ra" instruction in this situation because the j op code is meant to read a label, not a register. The instruction "jr $ra" is meant to read an address from a register and jump to that address, while the j op code is meant to read a label and jump to wherever that label is located. 
6. The return address is saved at line 11. It is saved in register $ra. The value being saved to $ra is 0. This value makes no sense because it doesn't have a meaningful value. 
7. The program errors. "Error in : invalid program counter value: 0x00000000"
8. The line after the original jump was called. 
9. It realistically should be correct, although that has yet to be determined since this question specifically tells me not to execute the code. 
10. The new return address is: 0x0040001c. The output is 15.
