Activity #1:
1. 
    Text: 0x00400000
    Data: 0x10010000
2. Basic Assembly is strictly using the register number ($8) without any labels, which makes any jumps (j) have a corresponding hex address indicating where in the code the instructions need to go. Source Assembly contains more readable register names ($t0) and contains labels that can be used to jump from line to line. 
3. 20 bytes.
4. 8. 
5. This correlates to an increment in every 4 bits.
6. You can "set" a label equal to a string by declaring it as a word and setting that word equal to a value.
    m:      .word 20
7. Address: 0x10010004
8. https://courses.cs.vt.edu/cs2506/Fall2014/Notes/L04.MIPSAssemblyOverview.pdf
You're able to set a label to a string by using the ".asciiz" tag. There is also a similar tag ".ascii" which has the same function except each string declared using this tag doesn't have a null terminator "\0".
9. Address: 0x10010008, 0x1001000c, 0x10010010
10. Yes, it agrees. 
11. https://chortle.ccsu.edu/AssemblyTutorial/Chapter-22/ass22_4.html
    This basically says that in order to print a string, there are three source commands that are requires:
    li v0, 4        #This loads the system code 4 into the return value. System code 4 means "print string"
    la a0, str1         #This loads the beginning address of the string into the a0 register
    syscall         #This looks into the v0 register to perform the action specified on a0
12. la $t3, n 
    This instruction is meant to store the address of a label "n" into the register $t3. 

Activity #2:
1. Because that would make the processor run slower. Having less instructions ultimately makes the processor run more smoothly.
