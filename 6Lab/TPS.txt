Activity #1:
1. 
    Text: 0x00400000
    Data: 0x10010000
2. Basic Assembly is strictly using the register number ($8) without any labels, which makes any jumps (j) have a corresponding hex address indicating where in the code the instructions need to go. Source Assembly contains more readable register names ($t0) and contains labels that can be used to jump from line to line. 
3. 4 bytes.
4. 8. 
5. This correlates to an increment in every 4 bits.
6. You can "set" a label equal to a value by declaring it as a word and setting that word equal to a value.
    m:      .word 20
7. Address: 0x10010000
8. You're able to set a label to a string by using the ".asciiz" tag. There is also a similar tag ".ascii" which has the same function except each string declared using this tag doesn't have a null terminator "\0".
