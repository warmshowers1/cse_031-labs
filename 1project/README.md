# Cross Word Puzzle Analyzer

This is a program that's meant to analyze an inputted word search puzzle, formatted as a text file, and output the words found in the word search as well as the locations they were found. This is all done without using array notation, instead, using pointer notation. 

Currently the program only searches if a US state is contained in the puzzle, however this could be modified. 

Command to run the program as it stands:
```{shell}
bin/wordsearch puzzle/puzzle1.txt
```
