Activity #1:
1. *Completed*
2. *Completed*
3. *Completed*
4. li $v0, 5
   syscall
   add $t3, $0, $v0
5. No, we no longer need the declaration for n, nor the la and lw commands. 
6. *Completed*

Activity #2:
1. When 5 is entered, the output is 29. I believe this can be verified by everyone else's answer to this question. 
2. *Completed*
3. *Completed*
4. Register $a0.
5. I expect it to be returned in $v0. Because of this we can simply move the returned value into $a0, that way we can replace the value in $v0 to perform the correct syscall. 
6. *Completed*
7. This is enough space reserved for 3 integers. It's currently not reserving any integer values in this storage. 
8. *Completed*
9. *Completed*
10. We need to save this value because we need to keep track of how large the number is since we're adding up their values at the end. 
11. *Completed*
12. It will have an incorrect value for $a0. Therefore we need to restore it to it's original value from when this iteration of the recursion call was made. 
13. *Completed*
14. *Completed*
15. It is the return address that we first saved when we first called the recursion function.
