# CSE 031 Assignments
This repo consists of all coding assignments assigned to me during my time in UC Merced's Computer Organization course.
I collaborated with [Preethi Merugumala](https://github.com/pmpreestar "Preethi Merugumala's GitHub Page") & [Valerie Nguyen](https://github.com/vvalerietn "Valerie Nguyen's GitHub Page") for a majority of these assignments. 
Some of these labs also required the use of [MARS MIPS](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/ "MARS MIPS Origin Site") in order to be completed. This is the link to find the MARS MIPS download information.
